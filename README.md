Im interested in system embedded coding.

You can reach me by commenting under one of my projects.

Im currently learning c++, asm.
//asm just so i can make a cool bootloader.

Main focus is gonna be  c++, python, js, html, css, asm.
Im only good in c++ right now.
I know how to automated task in python though cause how easy it is to understand the language with its epic libs.
js, html, and css for making websites. Ive already made one but havent published it yet cause I dont know how to and I dont have money to do so.
asm, its funny cause im having trouble even trying to start on it since everytime i try to my ide goes to doom doom if i ever try running the asm code.
c++, ah what a beautiful language. (I secretly am in love with this and i hate it so much). This language scares me when i see pros use it. 
thats basically it.
